<h1 align="left">Cookie Cringe</h1>

<p align="left">This project is a playful, totally fake web page that mimics a "too good to be true" experience, designed purely for amusement. The page presents an absurdly intrusive cookie consent modal that users are forced to interact with. Here's the twist: after submitting their data, they are told that their information has been "sold" on the dark web before they're finally allowed to view the article.</p>

<p align="left">Note: No actual data is collected or stored. Everything is done purely on the frontend using JavaScript for comedic effect. The data input is simply simulated and never transmitted or saved. The entire process is just for fun, so no harm is done!</p>
